# digroot

The goal of digroot is to calculate digital roots. A digital root is a single
digit that is obtained through a recursive sum of digits.

This package was inspired by a [Tweet from Thomas Morill](https://twitter.com/tsmorrill/status/1028108510746226688)

For example, the digital root of 77 is 5:

```{r digroot}
7 + 7
1 + 4
```

The *digroot* package automates this with the `dig_root()` function:

```{r dig_root}
digroot::dig_root(77)
```

It's also vectorized, which means that you can get the multiplication
table like so:

```{r multiply}
sapply(1:9, function(i) digroot::dig_root(i * (1:9)))
```


You can find the immediate digital sum of a number by using the `dig_sum()`
function:

```{r dig_sum}
digroot::dig_sum(77)
digroot::dig_sum(14)
```

## Installation

You can install digroot from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("zkamvar/digroot")
```
